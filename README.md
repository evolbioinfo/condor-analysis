# Accurate Detection of Convergent Mutations in Large Protein Alignments with ConDor


### Marie MOREL, Frédéric LEMOINE, Anna ZHUKOVA and Olivier GASCUEL

In this repository you can find data and files used in the ConDor paper. \
ConDor is a workflow to detect convergent evolution at the scale of the mutation in protein alignments. 
It is available from a web service located at https://condor.pasteur.cloud/

## Help
* data folder: data described in the Materials and Methods section, including sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.  
* results folder: csv files corresponding to the outputs provided by ConDor, as well as the results from FADE and PCOC. 
* src folder: scripts used to analyze the data and obtain tables and figures as in the ConDor Paper. You can also find the commands used to run the various tools (FADE, PCOC, JPHMM...). You can also find the scripts used to obtain each table and figure in ConDor paper.
