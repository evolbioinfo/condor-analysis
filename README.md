# Sensitive Detection of Site-wise Convergent Evolution in Large Protein Alignments with ConDor

### Marie MOREL, Frédéric LEMOINE and Olivier GASCUEL

In this repository you can find data and files used in the ConDor paper. \
ConDor is a workflow to detect convergent evolution without prior knowledge of phenotype in protein alignments. 
It is available from a web service located at https://condor.pasteur.cloud/

## Help
* data folder: data described in the Materials and Methods section, including sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.  
* results folder: csv files corresponding to the outputs provided by ConDor, as well as the results from MEME, BayesTraits and PCOC. 
* src folder: scripts used to construct the synthetic dataset as well as the commands used to run the various tools (MEME, PastML, BayesTraits,... )
